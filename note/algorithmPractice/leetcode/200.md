# 200 Number of Islands

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]  
]  
Output: 1  

Example 2:  

Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]  
]  
Output: 3

遍历到是陆地的点，计数，将其转为海洋，对其相邻的点进行递归

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<grid.length;++i){
            for(int j=0;j<grid[0].length;++j){
                if(grid[i][j]=='1') {
                    remove(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void remove(char[][] grid, int i, int j){
        grid[i][j]='0';
        if(i+1<grid.length && grid[i+1][j]=='1') remove(grid, i+1, j);
        if(i-1>=0 && grid[i-1][j]=='1') remove(grid, i-1, j);
        if(j+1<grid[0].length && grid[i][j+1]=='1') remove(grid, i, j+1);
        if(j-1>=0 && grid[i][j-1]=='1') remove(grid, i, j-1);
    }
}
