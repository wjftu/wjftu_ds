# 617 Merge Two Binary Trees

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/)

You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

Example 1:

Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]

Example 2:

Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
Output: [2,2]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 2000].
`-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

递归，如果某个节点两棵树的子节点都不为空，则为它们的和，如果只有一个不为空，则该子节点的子树为新树的子树

~~~java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1==null && root2==null) return null;
        
        if(root1!=null && root2!=null){
            TreeNode nNode=new TreeNode(root1.val+root2.val);
            nNode.left=mergeTrees(root1.left,root2.left);
            nNode.right=mergeTrees(root1.right,root2.right);
            return nNode;
        }
        return root1==null?root2:root1;
    }
